### Architecture Progress

#### Completed Architecture Components
1. **Data I/O Layer** âœ… - Complete NIfTI, design matrix, contrast file handling
2. **Backend Abstraction Layer** âœ… - CPU, MPS backends with factory selection
3. **Core Engine - Statistics** âœ… - GLM computation with multiple backends  
4. **Core Engine - Permutation** âœ… - Advanced permutation strategies
5. **Core Engine - Correction** âœ… - Multiple comparison corrections
6. **CLI Interface** âœ… - Full command-line interface with correction support

#### Next: Core Engine - TFCE
- Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement implementation
- Critical for neuroimaging spatial statistics
- Final major statistical component needed

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 12: TFCE Implementation)

#### Research Phase
1. Study Smith & Nichols (2009) TFCE paper
2. Examine FSL randomise source code for TFCE implementation
3. Review PSEUDOCODE.md for FSL-compatible TFCE algorithms
4. Create detailed implementation plan

#### Implementation Phase (Following TDD)
1. **Create TFCE module structure**
   - `src/accelperm/core/tfce.py` 
   - Define TFCE class and interface
   - Write failing tests first (RED phase)

2. **Implement basic TFCE algorithm**
   - Threshold stepping with configurable dh parameter
   - Connected component labeling for cluster detection
   - Height (H) and extent (E) weighting calculations
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)

3. **Optimize and integrate**
   - GPU optimization for parallel threshold iterations
   - Memory optimization for large statistical maps
   - Integration with existing correction framework
   - Refactor for performance while maintaining tests (REFACTOR phase)

4. **Validation and testing**
   - Compare outputs with FSL randomise TFCE results
   - Test on known datasets for statistical accuracy
   - Comprehensive unit tests for edge cases
   - Performance benchmarking

#### Technical Considerations
- **TFCE Algorithm**: Threshold-free approach avoiding arbitrary thresholds
- **Mathematical Formula**: TFCE(h) = âˆ«[0â†’h] e(h')^E Ã— h'^H dh'
- **Key Parameters**: 
  - dh: threshold step size (typically 0.1)
  - E: extent exponent (typically 0.5)  
  - H: height exponent (typically 2.0)
- **Performance**: Critical to optimize for large neuroimaging datasets

### Performance and Technical Notes

#### Current State
- MPS backend functional but not optimized for speed
- CPU-GPU data transfers still present performance bottleneck
- Chunking system prevents memory issues on large datasets
- Statistical accuracy prioritized over performance (as intended)

#### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Correction Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing CLI and backend system
2. **Statistical Accuracy**: All corrections follow established neuroimaging standards
3. **Extensibility**: Abstract base class pattern allows easy addition of new correction methods
4. **User Experience**: Automatic fallback warnings guide users to appropriate methods

**Major Achievement**: The project now provides a nearly complete alternative to FSL randomise with modern GPU acceleration and comprehensive statistical corrections. Only TFCE implementation remains for Phase 3 completion.

### Known Issues
1. **Minor Linting Issues**: Some trailing whitespace and formatting issues remain
   - Pre-commit hooks cleaning up formatting automatically
   - Core functionality unaffected
   
2. **Performance Optimization Deferred**: Focus remains on statistical accuracy
   - MPS backend prioritizes correctness over speed
   - Performance optimization planned for Phase 4
   
3. **CUDA Backend**: Still not implemented (Week 6 deferred)
   - MPS backend covers Apple Silicon GPU acceleration
   - CUDA implementation can be added in optimization phase

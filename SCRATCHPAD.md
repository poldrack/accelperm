## NOTES

## Project State Summary (2025-08-27)

### Current Status
**Phase**: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Overall Progress**: 30/216 tasks completed (14%)
**Phase 1 Progress**: 30/52 tasks completed (58%)

### Recently Completed (Week 2 Major Breakthrough)
- ✅ **Backend abstraction layer implemented using proper TDD**
  - Complete Backend ABC with abstract methods (is_available, compute_glm)
  - Modern Python 3.12+ type annotations (X | Y syntax)
  - Comprehensive test suite with proper TDD methodology
- ✅ **Core orchestrator structure implemented using proper TDD**
  - Orchestrator class with backend integration
  - Proper initialization and run method interface
  - Full test coverage for orchestrator functionality
- ✅ **TDD methodology successfully established**
  - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle strictly followed
  - 9 working test cases across 3 test files
  - 83% test coverage achieved

### Major Improvements Since Last Session
**Code Quality:**
- Transitioned from empty placeholder files to working implementations
- Proper abstract base class patterns implemented
- Type-safe interfaces with comprehensive type hints
- Pre-commit hooks configured and working

**Testing Foundation:**
- TDD principles now enforced and documented in CLAUDE.md
- Test files: test_backend_base.py, test_orchestrator.py
- Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking
- All tests passing with good coverage metrics

**Architecture:**
- Backend abstraction layer provides foundation for CPU/MPS/CUDA backends
- Orchestrator coordinates workflow between components
- Clean separation of concerns established

### Current State Analysis
**Strengths:**
- **Solid TDD foundation established** - Critical milestone achieved
- **Core architecture components implemented** - Backend & Orchestrator done
- Modern Python practices (type hints, ABC patterns, proper imports)
- Comprehensive test coverage with proper CI-ready structure
- Clean, maintainable codebase ready for extension

**Next Critical Steps:**
1. **Error handling framework** - Custom exceptions and logging (in progress)
2. **Configuration management** - Pydantic-based settings system
3. **Data I/O layer** - NIfTI file handling implementation
4. **CPU backend implementation** - First concrete backend

### Blockers/Concerns Resolved
- ✅ **TDD implementation gap closed** - Now following proper RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- ✅ **Test foundation established** - 9 tests running successfully
- ✅ **Core architecture defined** - Backend abstraction and orchestrator working
- ❌ **CI/CD pipeline still pending** - Need GitHub Actions workflow
- ❌ **Configuration management missing** - Need Pydantic settings

### Technical Notes
- Project uses `uv` for all Python operations (added emphasis to CLAUDE.md)
- Package name is "accelperm" (not "gpu_randomise" as in some docs)
- Structure follows modern Python packaging standards
- Ready for actual implementation phase

**Current Branch State:**
- Modified: src/accelperm/io/contrast.py (implementation COMPLETE)
- All other I/O components committed and complete
- Untracked: tests/unit/test_io_contrast.py (comprehensive test suite COMPLETE)

### Major Progress Since Last Update
**Week 2 Completion:**
- ✅ **Complete Phase 1 Week 2 core architecture** (fully implemented)
  - Backend abstraction layer with comprehensive ABC interface
  - Core orchestrator for workflow coordination and pipeline management
  - Logging framework with colored output, progress reporting, and system info
  - Configuration management using Pydantic with TOML/env variable support
  - Error handling framework with hierarchical exceptions and recovery suggestions
  - TDD-compliant test structure (tests fail until implementations exist)

**Architecture Patterns Implemented:**
- Strategy pattern for backends, factory pattern for loaders
- Observer pattern for progress reporting as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Proper dependency injection and testability

### Current State Analysis
**Strengths:**
- **Week 3 Data I/O nearly complete** - NiftiLoader fully implemented
- **Solid TDD foundation maintained** - Comprehensive test coverage
- **Real functionality delivered** - Not just skeleton/placeholder code
- **Memory optimization features** - Lazy loading, chunking, masking
- **Robust error handling** - File validation, data integrity checks
- **Modern Python practices** - Type hints, proper exception handling

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Begin Week 4** - CPU backend implementation and basic GLM
2. **Implement CPU backend with GLM computing** - Start with statistics module
3. **Create initial CLI interface** - Basic command structure with Typer
4. **Prepare for GPU acceleration** - Foundation ready for MPS/CUDA backends

### Implementation Quality Notes
- **Not skeleton code** - Actual working implementations with real functionality
- **TDD maintained** - Tests written first, implementations follow
- **Memory efficiency** - Chunking and lazy loading for large neuroimaging files
- **Error handling** - Proper validation and informative error messages
- **Type safety** - Full type hints throughout
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

### Technical Architecture Status
**Completed Components:**
- ✅ Backend abstraction layer (ABC with is_available, compute_glm)
- ✅ Core orchestrator (workflow coordination)
- ✅ Logging framework (colored output, progress reporting)
- ✅ Configuration management (Pydantic with TOML support)
- ✅ Error handling framework (hierarchical exceptions)
- ✅ NIfTI I/O layer (full NiftiLoader implementation)

**Ready for Implementation:**
- [ ] CPU backend with GLM computing (foundation ready, tests needed)
- [ ] Statistics module with OLS solver (structure ready)
- [ ] CLI interface with basic commands (structure ready)
- [ ] Integration testing for complete workflows

## Project State Summary (2025-08-27 Refresh)

### Current Status
**Branch**: dev/week3-data-io  
**Phase**: Week 3 - Data I/O Layer Implementation  
**Overall Progress**: 79/221 tasks completed (36%)  
**Week 3 Progress**: 32/36 tasks completed (91%)  

### Current Work in Progress
**Data I/O Layer Implementation:**

  - All validation methods (_check_data_integrity, _validate_dimensions, etc.)
  - 14 tests all passing (100% pass rate), 90.22% code coverage
- ✅ **DesignMatrixLoader class COMPLETED** - Comprehensive design matrix handling
  - CSV/TSV loading with pandas backend
  - Categorical variable encoding (one-hot encoding)
  - Intercept column addition and standardization support
  - Data validation (rank, missing values, constant columns)
  - Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for correlated regressors
  - FSL and SPM format compatibility
  - Utility functions: load_design_matrix, validate_design_matrix, create_contrast_matrix
  - 17 tests all passing (100% pass rate), 90.22% code coverage
  - TDD cycle completed: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- ✅ **OutputWriter class COMPLETED** - Comprehensive neuroimaging output handling

  - P-value map output with range checking (0-1 validation)
  - Corrected p-value maps and TFCE map support
  - Cluster table generation in text format
  - Batch processing for multiple maps
  - Format compatibility (FSL, SPM styles) and metadata support
  - Analysis logging with JSON output
  - Utility functions: save_statistical_map, save_p_value_map, generate_cluster_table, create_results_summary
  - 14 tests all passing (100% pass rate), 78.57% code coverage
  - TDD cycle completed: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

**Current Branch State:**
- Modified: src/accelperm/io/nifti.py (implementation COMPLETE)
- Modified: src/accelperm/io/design.py (implementation COMPLETE)
- Modified: src/accelperm/io/output.py (implementation COMPLETE)
- Committed: tests/unit/test_io_nifti.py, tests/unit/test_io_design.py (comprehensive test suites COMPLETE)
- Untracked: tests/unit/test_io_output.py (comprehensive test suite COMPLETE)

### Major Progress Since Last Update
**Week 2 Completion:**
- ✅ **Complete Phase 1 Week 2 core architecture** (fully implemented)
  - Backend abstraction layer with comprehensive ABC interface
  - Core orchestrator for workflow coordination and pipeline management  
  - Logging framework with colored output, progress reporting, and system info
  - Configuration management using Pydantic with TOML/env variable support
  - Error handling framework with hierarchical exceptions and recovery suggestions
  - TDD-compliant test structure (tests fail until implementations exist)

**Architecture Patterns Implemented:**
- Strategy pattern for backends, factory pattern for loaders
- Observer pattern for progress reporting as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Proper dependency injection and testability

### Current State Analysis
**Strengths:**
- **Week 3 Data I/O nearly complete** - NiftiLoader fully implemented
- **Solid TDD foundation maintained** - Comprehensive test coverage
- **Real functionality delivered** - Not just skeleton/placeholder code
- **Memory optimization features** - Lazy loading, chunking, masking
- **Robust error handling** - File validation, data integrity checks
- **Modern Python practices** - Type hints, proper exception handling

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Complete remaining Week 3 tasks** - Contrast file loader or output writer
2. **Move to Week 4** - CPU backend implementation and basic GLM  
3. **Prepare for GPU acceleration** - Foundation ready for MPS/CUDA backends

### Implementation Quality Notes
- **Not skeleton code** - Actual working implementations with real functionality
- **TDD maintained** - Tests written first, implementations follow
- **Memory efficiency** - Chunking and lazy loading for large neuroimaging files
- **Error handling** - Proper validation and informative error messages
- **Type safety** - Full type hints throughout
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

### Technical Architecture Status
**Completed Components:**
- ✅ Backend abstraction layer (ABC with is_available, compute_glm)
- ✅ Core orchestrator (workflow coordination)
- ✅ Logging framework (colored output, progress reporting)
- ✅ Configuration management (Pydantic with TOML support)  
- ✅ Error handling framework (hierarchical exceptions)
- ✅ NIfTI I/O layer (full NiftiLoader implementation)

**Ready for Implementation:**
- [ ] Design matrix loader (tests exist, implementation needed)
- [ ] Output writer module (tests exist, implementation needed)
- [ ] CPU backend (foundation ready)
- [ ] CLI interface (structure ready)

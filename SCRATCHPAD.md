## NOTES

## Project State Summary (2025-08-27)

### Current Status
**Phase**: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Overall Progress**: 24/216 tasks completed (11%)
**Phase 1 Progress**: 24/52 tasks completed (46%)

### Recently Completed (Week 1)
- ✅ Full project structure created with proper directory layout
- ✅ pyproject.toml configured with uv build system
- ✅ Development tools configured (ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit)
- ✅ Documentation structure established (Sphinx, README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- ✅ Core module files created (though empty/placeholder)

### Current State Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation with proper project structure
- All development tools properly configured
- Comprehensive documentation framework in place
- Using modern Python packaging with uv

**Critical Gap:**
- **All implementation files are empty or contain minimal placeholder content**
- No actual business logic implemented yet
- No test cases written (0 test files exist)
- Backend abstraction layer not defined
- Core algorithms not implemented

### Next Priority Tasks (Week 2 Focus)
1. **Implement backend abstraction layer** - Define the Backend ABC interface
2. **Create core orchestrator structure** - Main workflow coordinator skeleton
3. **Set up error handling framework** - Custom exceptions and logging
4. **Write first unit tests** - Start TDD cycle

### Blockers/Concerns
- Need to transition from "file creation" to "actual implementation"
- No tests exist yet - critical for TDD approach
- CI/CD pipeline not yet configured
- Missing configuration management system

### Technical Notes
- Project uses `uv` for all Python operations (added emphasis to CLAUDE.md)
- Package name is "accelperm" (not "gpu_randomise" as in some docs)
- Structure follows modern Python packaging standards
- Ready for actual implementation phase
